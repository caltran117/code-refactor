# <code-refactor: Horiseon, Marketing Agency>

## Description

The purpose was to improve coding into the HTML semantic format. I built this project to be able to create a social marketing sample webpage. This page solves the problem of clutterness in the HTML and makes it easier to view and modify. I was able to learn how to modify the HTML into HTML semantics and how to link them to the css. I was also able to learn how to use Devtool to make edits and search for specific code on the webpage while working with Visual Studio.
This is a website for the marketing agency Horiseon. It is optimized for search engines and contains specific related images, links, and content related to the company. Please visit the website: [here](https://caltran117.github.io/code-refactor/)
